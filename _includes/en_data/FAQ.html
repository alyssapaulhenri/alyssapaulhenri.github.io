            <h4 class="service-heading">What will the weather be like?</h4>  
            <p class="largepad text-muted">The weather is variable in Normandy. It could be sunny and hot, or it could be rainy and brisk. Check the weather of BellÃªme before the wedding and prepare for various potential types of weather.</p>
            <h4 class="service-heading">What will the language of the event be?</h4>  
            <p class="largepad text-muted"> A mix of English and French. You'll understand some things, and not others, and it's okay - welcome to our lives :) The most important part is to enjoy and celebrate together! </p>
            <h4 class="service-heading">How does the shuttle work?</h4>  
            <p class="largepad text-muted">You come yourself to the Domaine for the ceremony - there is a parking lot at the Domaine where you can leave your car. Then, throughout the night, as you're ready to go home, Sophie who works at the Domaine will be there to shuttle you back when you like (even if it's at 4 am); in other words, there is not *one time* with *one shuttle* that departs. She'll wait with the minivan and you can ask her to bring you home (remember the name of where you're staying). You leave your car at the Domaine, and Sophie will come back and pick you up to come to the brunch in the morning.</p>
